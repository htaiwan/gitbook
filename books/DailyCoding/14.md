# 14

This problem was recently asked by Google:
A look-and-say sequence is defined as the integer sequence beginning with a single digit in which the next term is obtained by describing the previous term. An example is easier to understand:

```
1      #
11     # one 1's
21     # two 1's
1211   # one 2, and one 1.
111221 # one 1, one 2, and two 1's.
```


Your task is, return the term of this sequence.

```python
def look_and_say(num):
  result = '1'
  for _ in range(1, num):
    new_rsult = '' # new_rsult = '12'
    chr = result[0] # chr = '1'
    count = 0
    for c in result: # '1', '2'
      if chr == c: 
        count += 1
      else:
        new_rsult += str(count) + chr # '11'
        count = 1
        chr = c # '2'

    result = new_rsult + str(count) + chr #'1112'
    
  return result

print(look_and_say(5))
      
```

The time-complexity of a recursive algorithm like this is tricky to calculate. But, we can see that the numbers are growing exponentially in length intuitively

This indicates exponential time-complexity. In actuality (according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence)), the precise value is that the length grows by Î» = 1.303577269034 each generation
